navigation using camera drag and moving arrows (->, <-, upward and downward)

==========WEEK1=============
* Spent 1 hour studying material on shadow mapping in opengl. 
* Spent another 3 hours setting up a basic demo
*spent 4 hours studying math  (Vectors , Matrices ..)
* total : 8 hours 
======= WEEK 2 ===============
* spent 2 hours installing GLM and stb-images and displaying shapes
*spent 3 hour studying shaders and transformations 
*spent 2 hour studying  3D with Coordinate Systems 
*spent 2 hour studying camera class and trying to do it
* total : 9 hours 
=======WEEK 3 =============
*spent 4 hours studying about Cleanup and Organization (include (Texture, Model, Mesh classes ) 
* spent 5 hours studying about   Lighting
*total : 9 hours 
=======WEEK 4 ============
* spent 2 hours isntalling CMake/ASSIMP  and  Object Loading
* spent 2 hours studying Physics 
* total : 4 hours
========== WEEK 5 ==========
* started repo making minimal Glad/GLFW example code with a rotating triangle to establish the working setup.
* adding a skybox with 6 textures for each side of the sky cube, images are taking from: https://opengameart.org/content/ulukais-space-skyboxes
* total : 8 hours
========== WEEK 6 ==========
* adding model loading using Assimp library, as initial step the planets are without motion and rotations.
textures are taken from: https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/
* total : 6 hours

========== WEEK 7 ==========
* adding rotations and motion to the planets using Newtonian gravity.
- Scaling:The system is not to scale because actual planet sizes are much smaller than distances - with entire solar system
on the screen, planets would be less than a pixel wide. Therefore, fake sizes are used, but simulation is still correct
- Orbits: For simulation to produce reasonable orbits, the program calculates initial velocities required for circular motion.
They are derived by considering gravity as a centripetal force 
- Stability: Since planets are very close together in this toy model,they can perturb and even deorbit each other.
This doesn't correspond to reality due to fake sizes,but should be ok for an experimental playground

--> problem faced: the earth's moon would sometimes separate from earth and fly to somewhere undefined, 
in other runs it would attach to sun, and creates its own orbit around it.

* total : 14 hours

========== WEEK 8 ==========
* solving the problem from previous week: 
for solving the problem we used actual disctances, masses and speeds which correspond to reality which made the simulation stable.
with actual disctances, planets are too small in comparison so their sizes are exaggerated to improve stability. Further exaggeration is hardly possible as this
would result in the Moon being inside the Earth, etc...
To support astonomically huge values and high precision,double type is used instead of float for simulation.
Also, 3D vector with double components is added (dvec3) instead of one with float components (vec3)

* we will implement the camera class later on... meanwhile the camera focuses on the Earth.

* total : 16 hours

========== WEEK 9 ==========
* adding ImGui to the project with the given functionality: 
- Adjust enlargement of planet sizes.
- hide/show planets
- focus on planets 
- edit mass and spin of each planet

--> problems faced: - when enlarging planets a collision may occure. 
		        - when focusing on planet x, to the observer it looks like the planet x is motionless while the other planets moving in their orbits.

* total : 10 hours

========== WEEK 10 ==========
* adding a button for adding a moon for each planet separetley.
* light shading 
* camera class (rotation using mouse dragging and navagation using arrow keys (-> , <-, upwards key and downwards key).
* adding resume/pause button for pausing the simulation or keeping it.

* total : 9 hours

========== WEEK 11  ==========
*finishing up the project, changing the scaling of planets for easier navagation and shorter time to reach planets.. 
Sun size increased by 50 times, and other planets by 1000 times with appropriate distances.

* total : 8 hours
